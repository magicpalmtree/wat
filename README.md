## wat

Finally, community-built cheat sheets and docs for every coder, in every language and major framework. At the tip of your fingers.

##### Why?

Because **wat** is forgetting the syntax to splice an Array for the 20th time.

Because **wat** is having to search `js array splice`, sift through [W3Schools](http://www.w3fools.com/) and [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/) results, `Command + Click` three [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) tabs, close the first one, digest the second and then scroll to the answer to remember... again.

Because I would rather just type:

`wat js array splice`
