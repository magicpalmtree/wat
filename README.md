# Wat

> Your syntax nightmares are over.

Finally, community-built cheat sheets for every coder, in every language and major framework. At the tip of your fingers.

Wat is an interactive app built to drastically reduce time spent searching for syntax and code usage questions. If you forgot how to write a CSS transition, simply type `css transition`. Wat finds what you want, providing exactly and only what you need: a basic description and usage samples.

#### Wat covers everything

Wat provides the only centralized source of syntax cheat sheets for every language and every major framework and library. If a repo has an API and is sufficiently used by the community, it's supported here; be it jQuery, SASS, Go, Dragula or Rails.

#### It's smart

Wat combines a document index, edit-distance algorithms, tabbed auto-completion and common sense to make sure you get what you asked for. It auto-updates when the community adds content, and optimizes its performance based on the content you use most.

#### It's easy

### FAQ

- [Why Wat?](#why)

#### Why Wat?

Because **wat** is forgetting the syntax to splice an Array for the 10th time.

Because **wat** is having to search `js splice an array`, sift through [W3Schools](http://www.w3fools.com/) and [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/) results, `Command + Click` three [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) tabs, close the first one, digest the second and then scroll to the answer to remember... again.

Because I would rather just type:

`wat js array splice`

[Necessity is the mother of invention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_is_the_mother_of_invention), and I needed this.
