# Wat

> Your syntax nightmares are over.

#### Wat is nearing its launch, and you can help!

##### Feel free to install and try Wat out, as long as you are running io.js. Wanted are suggestions on how to make Wat even more ridiculously easy to use and insanely helpful. All document contributions are welcome as well!

---

Finally, community-built cheat sheets for every coder, in every language and major framework. At the tip of your fingers.

Wat is an interactive app built to drastically reduce time spent searching for syntax and code usage questions. If you forgot how to write a CSS transition, simply type `css transition`. Wat finds what you want, providing exactly and only what you need: a basic description and usage samples.

#### Wat covers everything

Wat provides the only centralized source of syntax cheat sheets for every language and every major framework and library. If it has an API and is used by the community, it's supported here; be it [jQuery](https://jquery.com), [Go](https://golang.org/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula) or [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

#### It's smart

Wat combines a document index, edit-distance algorithms, tabbed auto-completion and common sense to make sure you get what you asked for. It auto-updates when the community adds content, and optimizes its performance based on the content you use most.

#### Wat shreds red tape like a frisky cat

Wat's content is not perfect, it isn't formal and it isn't pedantic. Wat doesn't aim to provide letter-perfect, offical documentation for languages. Work like that [is in good hands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

If you're building a web browser, refer to [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) for specifications. Wat is targeted for the 99.99% of us who have the basic familiarity with a Library and simply need to look up API or usage samples. 

#### It's easy

Wat was designed for ease. It takes you:

### FAQ

- [Why Wat?](#why)

##### Why Wat?

Because **wat** is forgetting the syntax to splice an Array for the 10th time.

Because **wat** is having to search `js splice an array`, sift through [W3Schools](http://www.w3fools.com/) and [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/) results, `Command + Click` three [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) tabs, close the first one, digest the second and then scroll to the answer to remember... again.

Because I would rather just type:

`wat js array splice`

[Necessity is the mother of invention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_is_the_mother_of_invention), and I needed this.

##### Sorry, I don't speak Node

Don't worry, it's really not a problem:

You're using a web browser, right? Web browsers interpret Javascript. You don't have to write JS to use a web browser. Node similarly interprets JS everywhere else. NPM is the package manager for Javascript. 

Installation is easy and you really should do it: There's hundreds of incredible apps you'll be take advantage of without having to write a single line of Javascript.

Node installation links:

- [Mac Install](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.7/node-v0.12.7.pkg)
- [Linux Install](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.7/node-v0.12.7-linux-x64.tar.gz): [64 bit](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.7/node-v0.12.7-linux-x64.tar.gz), [32 bit](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.7/node-v0.12.7-linux-x86.tar.gz)
- [Windows Install](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.7/x64/node-v0.12.7-x64.msi): [64 bit](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.7/x64/node-v0.12.7-x64.msi), [32 bit](https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.7/node-v0.12.7-x86.msi)

When done, open a terminal and type:

```bash
npm install --global wat
```

This automatically installs a software package from [npmjs.com](http://npmjs.com) and makes the command `wat` recognized globally by your computer, so you just simply enter `wat` anywhere in your terminal. Easy, right? And you're still a proud `[insert language here...]` programmer.
