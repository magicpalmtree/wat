Vantage gives you a new perspective into your live node application not previously available.

An extension of Vorpal, Vantage turns your live Node app into a immersive CLI.Accessible remotely or locally, Vantage lets you build your own API for your application and import community extensions, introducing a new means of live diagnostics and activity for your `dev` and `prod` environments.

- First-class CLI: tab completion, history, you name it.
- Build your own API with the familiar syntax of `commander.js`.
- SSH-like client / server setup for remote access to your live Node app.
- Production-ready, with authentication middleware and a basic firewall.
- Built-in REPL.

Unlike any other REPL or CLI module, Vantage allows you to remotely connect to your live app and access the CLI transparently, exactly as you would in an SSH session. Vantage can connect through an unlimited number of live Node instances across multiple machines, piping commands and information to and from your local terminal.
